# 💫 About Me
📚 *“Forever a student, sometimes a teacher, always a coder.”*

Hi there 👋, I’m Ashley — a passionate developer and tech enthusiast focused on building practical, scalable, and impactful solutions. I work across **web development, desktop applications, and backend systems**, with experience in **React + Vite, FastAPI, Django, and PHP + MySQL**.  

I enjoy taking ideas from scratch to fully functional products, from **e‑commerce platforms and dashboards** to **utility apps** like PDF search tools and duplicate file scanners. My GitHub reflects both **learning milestones** and **real‑world projects**.  

🔭 **Currently working on:** Full‑stack apps with MERN & Django, plus a few side projects for fun.  
💡 **Goal:** To keep learning, keep building, and keep fixing (without always doing it in production 😅).
